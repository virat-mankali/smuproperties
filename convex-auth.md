# Convex & Clerk

[Clerk](https://clerk.com) is an authentication platform providing login via passwords, social identity providers, one-time email or SMS access codes, and multi-factor authentication and user management.

## Get started[​](#get-started "Direct link to Get started")

Convex offers a provider that is specifically for integrating with Clerk called `<ConvexProviderWithClerk>`. It works with any of Clerk's React-based SDKs, such as the Next.js and Expo SDKs.

See the following sections for the Clerk SDK that you're using:

* [React](#react) - Use this as a starting point if your SDK is not listed
* [Next.js](#nextjs)
* [TanStack Start](#tanstack-start)

### React[​](#react "Direct link to React")

**Example:** [React with Convex and Clerk](https://github.com/get-convex/template-react-vite-clerk)

This guide assumes you already have a working React app with Convex. If not follow the [Convex React Quickstart](/quickstart/react.md) first. Then:

1. Sign up for Clerk

   Sign up for a free Clerk account at [clerk.com/sign-up](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-up).

   ![Sign up to Clerk](/screenshots/clerk-signup.png)

2. Create an application in Clerk

   Choose how you want your users to sign in.

   ![Create a Clerk application](/screenshots/clerk-createapp.png)

3. Activate the Convex integration in Clerk

   In the Clerk Dashboard, activate the [Convex integration](https://dashboard.clerk.com/apps/setup/convex).

   ![Activate the Convex integration in Clerk](/screenshots/clerk-convex-integration.png)

   Copy your Clerk app's *Frontend API URL*. In development, its format will be `https://verb-noun-00.clerk.accounts.dev`. In production, its format will be `https://clerk.<your-domain>.com`.

4. Configure Convex with the Clerk issuer domain

   In your app's `convex` folder, create a new file `auth.config.ts` with the following code. This is the server-side configuration for validating access tokens.

   convex/auth.config.ts

   TS

   ```
   import { AuthConfig } from "convex/server";

   export default {
     providers: [
       {
         // Replace with your Clerk Frontend API URL
         // or with `process.env.CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN`
         // and configure CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN on the Convex Dashboard
         // See https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk#configuring-dev-and-prod-instances
         domain: process.env.CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN!,
         applicationID: "convex",
       },
     ]
   } satisfies AuthConfig;
   ```

5. Deploy your changes

   Run `npx convex dev` to automatically sync your configuration to your backend.

   ```
   npx convex dev
   ```

6. Install clerk

   In a new terminal window, install the Clerk React SDK:

   ```
   npm install @clerk/clerk-react
   ```

7. Set your Clerk API keys

   In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk Publishable Key and set it as the `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` environment variable. If you're using Vite, you will need to prefix it with `VITE_`.

   .env

   ```
   VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
   ```

8. Configure ConvexProviderWithClerk

   Both Clerk and Convex have provider components that are required to provide authentication and client context.

   You should already have `<ConvexProvider>` wrapping your app. Replace it with `<ConvexProviderWithClerk>`, and pass Clerk's `useAuth()` hook to it.

   Then, wrap it with `<ClerkProvider>`. `<ClerkProvider>` requires a `publishableKey` prop, which you can set to the `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` environment variable.

   src/main.tsx

   TS

   ```
   import React from "react";
   import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
   import App from "./App";
   import "./index.css";
   import { ClerkProvider, useAuth } from "@clerk/clerk-react";
   import { ConvexProviderWithClerk } from "convex/react-clerk";
   import { ConvexReactClient } from "convex/react";

   const convex = new ConvexReactClient(import.meta.env.VITE_CONVEX_URL as string);

   ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
     <React.StrictMode>
       <ClerkProvider publishableKey="pk_test_...">
         <ConvexProviderWithClerk client={convex} useAuth={useAuth}>
           <App />
         </ConvexProviderWithClerk>
       </ClerkProvider>
     </React.StrictMode>,
   );
   ```

9. Show UI based on authentication state

   You can control which UI is shown when the user is signed in or signed out using Convex's `<Authenticated>`, `<Unauthenticated>` and `<AuthLoading>` helper components.

   In the following example, the `<Content />` component is a child of `<Authenticated>`, so its content and any of its child components are guaranteed to have an authenticated user, and Convex queries can require authentication.

   tip

   If you choose to build your own auth-integrated components without using the helpers, it's important to use the [`useConvexAuth()`](/api/modules/react.md#useconvexauth) hook instead of Clerk's `useAuth()` hook when you need to check whether the user is logged in or not. The `useConvexAuth()` hook makes sure that the browser has fetched the auth token needed to make authenticated requests to your Convex backend, and that the Convex backend has validated it.

   src/App.tsx

   TS

   ```
   import { SignInButton, UserButton } from "@clerk/clerk-react";
   import { Authenticated, Unauthenticated, AuthLoading, useQuery } from "convex/react";
   import { api } from "../convex/_generated/api";

   function App() {
     return (
       <main>
         <Unauthenticated>
           <SignInButton />
         </Unauthenticated>
         <Authenticated>
           <UserButton />
           <Content />
         </Authenticated>
         <AuthLoading>
           <p>Still loading</p>
         </AuthLoading>
       </main>
     );
   }

   function Content() {
     const messages = useQuery(api.messages.getForCurrentUser);
     return <div>Authenticated content: {messages?.length}</div>;
   }

   export default App;
   ```

10. Use authentication state in your Convex functions

    If the client is authenticated, you can access the information stored in the JWT via `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity`.

    If the client isn't authenticated, `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity` will return `null`.

    **Make sure that the component calling this query is a child of `<Authenticated>` from `convex/react`**. Otherwise, it will throw on page load.

    convex/messages.ts

    TS

    ```
    import { query } from "./_generated/server";

    export const getForCurrentUser = query({
      args: {},
      handler: async (ctx) => {
        const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
        if (identity === null) {
          throw new Error("Not authenticated");
        }
        return await ctx.db
          .query("messages")
          .withIndex("by_author", (q) => q.eq("author", identity.email))
          .collect();
      },
    });
    ```

### Next.js[​](#nextjs "Direct link to Next.js")

**Example:** [Next.js with Convex and Clerk](https://github.com/get-convex/template-nextjs-clerk)

This guide assumes you already have a working Next.js app with Convex. If not follow the [Convex Next.js Quickstart](/quickstart/nextjs.md) first. Then:

1. Sign up for Clerk

   Sign up for a free Clerk account at [clerk.com/sign-up](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-up).

   ![Sign up to Clerk](/screenshots/clerk-signup.png)

2. Create an application in Clerk

   Choose how you want your users to sign in.

   ![Create a Clerk application](/screenshots/clerk-createapp.png)

3. Activate the Convex integration in Clerk

   In the Clerk Dashboard, activate the [Convex integration](https://dashboard.clerk.com/apps/setup/convex).

   ![Activate the Convex integration in Clerk](/screenshots/clerk-convex-integration.png)

   Copy your Clerk app's *Frontend API URL*. In development, its format will be `https://verb-noun-00.clerk.accounts.dev`. In production, its format will be `https://clerk.<your-domain>.com`.

4. Configure Convex with the Clerk issuer domain

   In your app's `convex` folder, create a new file `auth.config.ts` with the following code. This is the server-side configuration for validating access tokens.

   convex/auth.config.ts

   TS

   ```
   import { AuthConfig } from "convex/server";

   export default {
     providers: [
       {
         // Replace with your Clerk Frontend API URL
         // or with `process.env.CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN`
         // and configure CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN on the Convex Dashboard
         // See https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk#configuring-dev-and-prod-instances
         domain: process.env.CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN!,
         applicationID: "convex",
       },
     ]
   } satisfies AuthConfig;
   ```

5. Deploy your changes

   Run `npx convex dev` to automatically sync your configuration to your backend.

   ```
   npx convex dev
   ```

6. Install clerk

   In a new terminal window, install the Clerk Next.js SDK:

   ```
   npm install @clerk/nextjs
   ```

7. Set your Clerk API keys

   In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk Publishable and Secret Keys and set them as the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` environment variables, respectively.

   .env

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

8. Add Clerk middleware

   Clerk's `clerkMiddleware()` helper grants you access to user authentication state throughout your app.

   Create a `middleware.ts` file.

   In your `middleware.ts` file, export the `clerkMiddleware()` helper:

   ```
   import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

   export default clerkMiddleware()

   export const config = {
     matcher: [
       // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
       '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
       // Always run for API routes
       '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
     ],
   }
   ```

   By default, `clerkMiddleware()` will not protect any routes. All routes are public and you must opt-in to protection for routes.<https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware>) to learn how to require authentication for specific routes.

9. Configure ConvexProviderWithClerk

   Both Clerk and Convex have provider components that are required to provide authentication and client context.

   Typically, you'd replace `<ConvexProvider>` with `<ConvexProviderWithClerk>`, but with Next.js App Router, things are a bit more complex.

   `<ConvexProviderWithClerk>` calls `ConvexReactClient()` to get Convex's client, so it must be used in a Client Component. Your `app/layout.tsx`, where you would use `<ConvexProviderWithClerk>`, is a Server Component, and a Server Component cannot contain Client Component code. To solve this, you must first create a *wrapper* Client Component around `<ConvexProviderWithClerk>`.

   ```
   'use client'

   import { ReactNode } from 'react'
   import { ConvexReactClient } from 'convex/react'
   import { ConvexProviderWithClerk } from 'convex/react-clerk'
   import { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs'

   if (!process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL) {
     throw new Error('Missing NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL in your .env file')
   }

   const convex = new ConvexReactClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL)

   export default function ConvexClientProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
     return (
       <ConvexProviderWithClerk client={convex} useAuth={useAuth}>
         {children}
       </ConvexProviderWithClerk>
     )
   }
   ```

10. Wrap your app in Clerk and Convex

    Now, your Server Component, `app/layout.tsx`, can render `<ConvexClientProvider>` instead of rendering `<ConvexProviderWithClerk>` directly. It's important that `<ClerkProvider>` wraps `<ConvexClientProvider>`, and not the other way around, as Convex needs to be able to access the Clerk context.

    ```
    import type { Metadata } from 'next'
    import { Geist, Geist_Mono } from 'next/font/google'
    import './globals.css'
    import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'
    import ConvexClientProvider from '@/components/ConvexClientProvider'

    const geistSans = Geist({
      variable: '--font-geist-sans',
      subsets: ['latin'],
    })

    const geistMono = Geist_Mono({
      variable: '--font-geist-mono',
      subsets: ['latin'],
    })

    export const metadata: Metadata = {
      title: 'Clerk Next.js Quickstart',
      description: 'Generated by create next app',
    }

    export default function RootLayout({
      children,
    }: Readonly<{
      children: React.ReactNode
    }>) {
      return (
        <html lang="en">
          <body className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}>
            <ClerkProvider>
              <ConvexClientProvider>{children}</ConvexClientProvider>
            </ClerkProvider>
          </body>
        </html>
      )
    }
    ```

11. Show UI based on authentication state

    You can control which UI is shown when the user is signed in or signed out using Convex's `<Authenticated>`, `<Unauthenticated>` and `<AuthLoading>` helper components.

    In the following example, the `<Content />` component is a child of `<Authenticated>`, so its content and any of its child components are guaranteed to have an authenticated user, and Convex queries can require authentication.

    tip

    If you choose to build your own auth-integrated components without using the helpers, it's important to use the [`useConvexAuth()`](/api/modules/react.md#useconvexauth) hook instead of Clerk's `useAuth()` hook when you need to check whether the user is logged in or not. The `useConvexAuth()` hook makes sure that the browser has fetched the auth token needed to make authenticated requests to your Convex backend, and that the Convex backend has validated it.

    app/page.tsx

    TS

    ```
    "use client";

    import { Authenticated, Unauthenticated } from "convex/react";
    import { SignInButton, UserButton } from "@clerk/nextjs";
    import { useQuery } from "convex/react";
    import { api } from "../convex/_generated/api";

    export default function Home() {
      return (
        <>
          <Authenticated>
            <UserButton />
            <Content />
          </Authenticated>
          <Unauthenticated>
            <SignInButton />
          </Unauthenticated>
        </>
      );
    }

    function Content() {
      const messages = useQuery(api.messages.getForCurrentUser);
      return <div>Authenticated content: {messages?.length}</div>;
    }
    ```

12. Use authentication state in your Convex functions

    If the client is authenticated, you can access the information stored in the JWT via `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity`.

    If the client isn't authenticated, `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity` will return `null`.

    **Make sure that the component calling this query is a child of `<Authenticated>` from `convex/react`**. Otherwise, it will throw on page load.

    convex/messages.ts

    TS

    ```
    import { query } from "./_generated/server";

    export const getForCurrentUser = query({
      args: {},
      handler: async (ctx) => {
        const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
        if (identity === null) {
          throw new Error("Not authenticated");
        }
        return await ctx.db
          .query("messages")
          .withIndex("by_author", (q) => q.eq("author", identity.email))
          .collect();
      },
    });
    ```

**Example:** [TanStack Start with Convex and Clerk](https://github.com/get-convex/templates/tree/main/template-tanstack-start)

See the [TanStack Start with Clerk guide](/client/tanstack/tanstack-start/clerk.md) for more information.

## Next steps[​](#next-steps "Direct link to Next steps")

### Accessing user information in functions[​](#accessing-user-information-in-functions "Direct link to Accessing user information in functions")

See [Auth in Functions](/auth/functions-auth.md) to learn about how to access information about the authenticated user in your queries, mutations and actions.

See [Storing Users in the Convex Database](/auth/database-auth.md) to learn about how to store user information in the Convex database.

### Accessing user information client-side[​](#accessing-user-information-client-side "Direct link to Accessing user information client-side")

To access the authenticated user's information, use Clerk's `User` object, which can be accessed using Clerk's [`useUser()`](https://clerk.com/docs/hooks/use-user) hook. For more information on the `User` object, see the [Clerk docs](https://clerk.com/docs/references/javascript/user).

components/Badge.tsx

TS

```
export default function Badge() {
  const { user } = useUser();

  return <span>Logged in as {user.fullName}</span>;
}
```

## Configuring dev and prod instances[​](#configuring-dev-and-prod-instances "Direct link to Configuring dev and prod instances")

To configure a different Clerk instance between your Convex development and production deployments, you can use environment variables configured on the Convex dashboard.

### Configuring the backend[​](#configuring-the-backend "Direct link to Configuring the backend")

In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page. Copy your Clerk Frontend API URL. This URL is the issuer domain necessary for Convex to validate access tokens. In development, it's format will be `https://verb-noun-00.clerk.accounts.dev`. In production, it's format will be `https://clerk.<your-domain>.com`.

Paste your Clerk Frontend API URL into your `.env` file, set it as the `CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN` environment variable.

.env

```
CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN=https://verb-noun-00.clerk.accounts.dev
```

Then, update your `auth.config.ts` file to use the environment variable.

convex/auth.config.ts

TS

```
import { AuthConfig } from "convex/server";

export default {
  providers: [
    {
      domain: process.env.CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN!,
      applicationID: "convex",
    },
  ],
} satisfies AuthConfig;
```

**Development configuration**

In the left sidenav of the Convex [dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev), switch to your development deployment and set the values for your development Clerk instance.

<!-- -->

![Convex dashboard dev deployment settings](/screenshots/clerk-convex-dashboard.png)

Then, to switch your deployment to the new configuration, run `npx convex dev`.

**Production configuration**

In the left sidenav of the Convex [dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev), switch to your production deployment and set the values for your production Clerk instance.

<!-- -->

Then, to switch your deployment to the new configuration, run `npx convex deploy`.

### Configuring Clerk's API keys[​](#configuring-clerks-api-keys "Direct link to Configuring Clerk's API keys")

Clerk's API keys differ depending on whether they are for development or production. Don't forget to update the environment variables in your `.env` file as well as your hosting platform, such as Vercel or Netlify.

**Development configuration**

Clerk's Publishable Key for development follows the format `pk_test_...`.

.env.local

```
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_..."
```

**Production configuration**

Clerk's Publishable Key for production follows the format `pk_live_...`.

.env

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_live_..."
```

## Debugging authentication[​](#debugging-authentication "Direct link to Debugging authentication")

If a user goes through the Clerk login flow successfully, and after being redirected back to your page, `useConvexAuth()` returns `isAuthenticated: false`, it's possible that your backend isn't correctly configured.

The `auth.config.ts` file contains a list of configured authentication providers. You must run `npx convex dev` or `npx convex deploy` after adding a new provider to sync the configuration to your backend.

For more thorough debugging steps, see [Debugging Authentication](/auth/debug.md).

## Under the hood[​](#under-the-hood "Direct link to Under the hood")

The authentication flow looks like this under the hood:

1. The user clicks a login button
2. The user is redirected to a page where they log in via whatever method you configure in
   <!-- -->
   Clerk
3. After a successful login
   <!-- -->
   Clerk
   <!-- -->
   redirects back to your page, or a different page which you configure via
   <!-- -->
   the
   <!-- -->
   [`afterSignIn`](https://clerk.com/docs/authentication/sign-in#override-ur-ls)
   <!-- -->
   prop
   <!-- -->
   .
4. The `ClerkProvider` now knows that the user is authenticated.
5. The `ConvexProviderWithClerk` fetches an auth token from
   <!-- -->
   Clerk
   <!-- -->
   .
6. The `ConvexReactClient` passes this token down to your Convex backend to validate
7. Your Convex backend retrieves the public key from
   <!-- -->
   Clerk
   <!-- -->
   to check that the token's signature is valid.
8. The `ConvexReactClient` is notified of successful authentication, and `ConvexProviderWithClerk` now knows that the user is authenticated with Convex. `useConvexAuth` returns `isAuthenticated: true` and the `Authenticated` component renders its children.

`ConvexProviderWithClerk` takes care of refetching the token when needed to make sure the user stays authenticated with your backend.
